h4. Installing the plugin

First you need to install the plugin into a Grails application:
using the recommended way, configure it as a dependency in @BuildConfig.groovy@:
{code}
plugins {
    runtime ':angularjs-resources:<plugin version>'
}
{code}

or the old way:
{code}
grails install-plugin angularjs-resources
{code}
