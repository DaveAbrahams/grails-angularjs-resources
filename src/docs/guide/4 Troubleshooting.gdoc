h4. Tricks

* Module "index" missing in webapp, when trying to use angularjs.Nge2eController
** Remember to define an "index" module in @ApplicationResources.groovy@, needed by Resources plugin



h4. Workarounds

* Running test-app gives: ERROR resource.ResourceMeta  - Resource not found: ... on some angularjs js files
** All it's good the same, those files are not required in test phase (at least now)
