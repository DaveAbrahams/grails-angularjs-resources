=================================

TODO
----

- finish initial version of the test webapp (more aligned to AngularJS-seed style) ...
- check/update install info in main README.md, and test it creating a new Grails webapp from scratch (but then delete it), important ...

- create documentation for the plugin and generate it ...
	- in the History put a reference to original author: "Vladimír Oraný", email: "vladimir.orany@appsatori.eu" ...
- publish generated documentation for the plugin in my GitHUB Pages ...

- before publishing the new release, set a version higher than the last published in Grails Repository, for example set 1.0.6 ...
- just after publishing the new release, update docs/links in Grails Plugin web page ...

- update AngularJS to latest stable (currently 1.0.7), update docs, etc ... then re-tag and re-deploy the updated plugin ...


- update dependencies to resources 1.2.x, but in a later plugin release (ex. 1.1.x) ...

- verify if remove angular-manual.js ...
- verify if remove (or move in a test configuration) the angular-scenario.js (and other test-related sources, like angular-mocks.js) ...
	- or verify al least if exclude those files with a dedicated flag (set up in the webapp that uses the plugin) ...


- etc ...
